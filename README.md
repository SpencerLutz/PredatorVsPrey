# PredatorVsPrey
Some simple environment simulations I did a while back

The first one is purely a cellular automaton. The green is just background, blue tiles are food, yellow tiles are herbivores, and red tiles are carnivores.  

The second version is interactive. The black tile is your player, and the arrow keys move it around. Eat the food and avoid the predators.

The third and final version, NatureSim, was a work in progress. There seem to be 10 different states possible, but I don't remember what each one was supposed to be. As of now, it does generate some interesting landscapes.

The fourth one, HiveMind, is unrelated. I'm not sure what it was planned to do but I'm adding it anyways because younger me would've wanted that.
