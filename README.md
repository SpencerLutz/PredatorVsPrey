# PredatorVsPrey
Some simple environment simulations I did a while back

The first one is just a simulation; the second one is more interactive.  
This is a cellular automaton. The green is just background, blue tiles are food, yellow tiles are herbivores, and red tiles are carnivores.  
In the second version, the black tile is your player, and the arrow keys move it around. Eat the food and avoid the predators.
