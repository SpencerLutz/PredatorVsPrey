# PredatorVsPrey
Some simple environment simulations I did a while back

The first one is a cellular automaton. The green is just background, blue tiles are food, yellow tiles are herbivores, and red tiles are carnivores.  

The second version is interactive. The black tile is your player, and the arrow keys move it around. Eat the food and avoid the predators.

The third and final version was a work in progress. There seem to be 10 different states possible, but I don't remember what each one was supposed to be. As of now, it does generate some interesting landscapes.
